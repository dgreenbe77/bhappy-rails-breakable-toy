Seeders::QuestionSeeder.seed

# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# datafile = Rails.root + 'lib/data/positive.txt'

# File.foreach(datafile) do |row|
#   Positive.find_or_create_by(word: row) do |pos|
#     pos.word = row.strip

#     puts "Word #{pos.word} processed"
#   end
# end
